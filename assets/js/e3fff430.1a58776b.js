This term and concept can be applied generically to any code.

However, it's important to note that it is not the ",(0,a.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"only")," pattern that can be used. In fact, it's entirely possible to use all three approaches for splitting up logic into functions, and usually a good idea as well.
